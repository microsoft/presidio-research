I work for [ORGANIZATION]
[PERSON] from [ORGANIZATION] is the keynote speaker
[FIRST_NAME] is from [ORGANIZATION]
The address of [ORGANIZATION] is [ADDRESS]
His social security number is [US_SSN]
Here's my SSN: [US_SSN]
[FIRST_NAME] is a very sympathetic person. He's also a good listener
[FIRST_NAME] is very reliable. You can always depend on him.
Why is [FIRST_NAME] so impulsive?
[PERSON] will be talking in the conference
have you heard [PERSON] speak yet?
Have you been to a [PERSON] concert before?
I'm so jealous! said [FIRST_NAME] to [FIRST_NAME]
The true gender of [FIRST_NAME] has been under debate for years, but the riff and building energy is a rock masterpiece regardless.
For my take on Mr. [LAST_NAME], see Guilty Pleasures: 5 Musicians Of The 70s You're Supposed To Hate (But Secretly Love)
Unlike the [LAST_NAME] novel, it's not about necrophilia. What it is about, I suppose is anyone's guess. A brilliant piece of baroque pop.
One of the most depressing songs on the list. He's injured from the waist down from [COUNTRY], but [FIRST_NAME] just has to get laid. Don't go to town, [FIRST_NAME]!
Is there a better crafted pop song on this list? [LAST_NAME] and [LAST_NAME] were precision engineers.
C'mon, sing it with me: "You picked a fine time to leave me [FIRST_NAME], four hungry children and a crop in the field..."
A tribute to [PERSON] – sadly, she wasn't impressed.
When they weren't singing about Hobbits, satanic felines and interstellar journeys, they were singing about the verses from [PERSON]'s Cautionary Tales. Is there a better example of unbridled creativity than early [LAST_NAME]?
A great song made even greater by a mandolin coda (not by [PERSON]).
[PERSON] listed his top 20 songs for Entertainment Weekly and had the balls to list this song at #15. (What did he put at #1 you ask? Answer:"Tube Snake Boogie" by [PERSON] – go figure)
From the film American graffiti (also features [PERSON]. What's not to love?
You can tell [FIRST_NAME] was a huge [PERSON] fan. Written when he was only 14.
This song by ex-Zombie [LAST_NAME] is a perfect example of why you shouldn't concentrate on the order of this list. An argument could be made that this should be at number one, and I wouldn't argue with it.
The title refers to [STREET] Street in [CITY]. It was on this street that many of the clubs where Metallica first played were situated. "Battery is found in me" shows that these early shows on [STREET] Street were important to them. Battery is where "lunacy finds you" and you "smash through the boundaries."
Blink-182 pay tribute here to the [COUNTRY]. Producer [PERSON] explained to Fuse TV: "We all liked the idea of writing a song about our state, where we live and love. To me it's the most beautiful place in the world, this song was us giving credit to how lucky we are to have lived here and grown up here, raising families here, the whole thing."
It may be too that [LAST_NAME] was influenced by an earlier song, "Carry Me Back To [COUNTRY]," which was arranged and sung by [PERSON] in 1847 (though [LAST_NAME]'s song was actually about a boat!).
The [PERSON] version recorded for [ORGANIZATION] became the first celebrity recording by a classical musician to sell one million copies. The song was awarded the seventh gold disc ever granted.
In [COUNTRY]] they have company songs, musical expressions of employee loyalty sung by salarymen. Unfortunately, as regular RR commenter [PERSON] points out, "most are horrible".
"The big three" of The Big Three Killed My Baby are the car manufacturers that dominate the economy of the White Stripes' home city [CITY]: [ORGANIZATION], [ORGANIZATION] and [ORGANIZATION]. "Don't feed me planned obsolescence," says [PERSON] in an uncharacteristically political song, lamenting the demise of the unions in the 60s.
[ORGANIZATION] songwriter [PERSON] employs corporate lingo in the first verse of his [ORGANIZATION] Resignation Letter
Mission Statement: This non-profit founded by radio executives "serves as an advocate for the value of music" and "supports its songwriters, composers and publishers by taking care of an important aspect of their careers – getting paid," according to the [ORGANIZATION] website. They offer blanket music licenses to businesses and organizations that allow them to play nearly 13 million musical works.
The [ORGANIZATION] Orchestra was founded in 1929. Since then, the TSO has grown from a volunteer community orchestra to a fully professional orchestra serving Southern [COUNTRY]
Celebrating its 10th year in [CITY], [ORGANIZATION] is a 501(c)3 that invites songwriters from around the world to Texas to share the universal language of music in collaborations designed to bridge cultures, build friendships and cultivate peace.
[ORGANIZATION] is the brainchild of our 3 founders: [PERSON], [PERSON] and [PERSON].  The idea was born (on the beach) while they were constructing a website to be the basis of another start-up idea.

Zoolander is a 2001 American action-comedy film directed by [PERSON] and starring [LAST_NAME]

On 29 March 2017, the [NATIONALITY] government formally began the process of withdrawal by invoking Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union
[FIRST_NAME] shouted at [FIRST_NAME]: "What are you doing here?"
