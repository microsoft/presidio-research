For my take on Mr. {{last_name}}, see Guilty Pleasures: 5 Musicians Of The 70s You're Supposed To Hate (But Secretly Love)
Unlike the {{last_name}} novel, it's not about necrophilia. What it is about, I suppose is anyone's guess. A brilliant piece of baroque pop.
One of the most depressing songs on the list. He's injured from the waist down from {{country}}, but {{first_name}} just has to get laid. Don't go to town, {{first_name}}!
Is there a better crafted pop song on this list? {{last_name}} and {{last_name}} were precision engineers.

From the film American graffiti (also features {{person}}. What's not to love?
You can tell {{first_name}} was a huge {{person}} fan. Written when he was only 14.
This song by ex-Zombie {{last_name}} is a perfect example of why you shouldn't concentrate on the order of this list. An argument could be made that this should be at number one, and I wouldn't argue with it.
The title refers to {{street}} Street in {{city}}. It was on this street that many of the clubs where Metallica first played were situated.

Blink-182 pay tribute here to the {{country}}. Producer {{person}} explained to Fuse TV: "We all liked the idea of writing a song about our state, where we live and love.
