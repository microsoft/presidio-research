# Why canonical entity mapping?

This document explains the design decisions behind the canonical entity mapping approach used in Presidio Evaluator. For the taxonomy structure and usage guide, see [Entity hierarchy](entity_hierarchy.md).

## Approaches to entity label mapping

Different tools and datasets use incompatible label vocabularies. Several strategies exist for reconciling them during
evaluation; each has a different cost/comparability trade-off.

**1. Score against own labels** — each model is evaluated only on the entity types it natively supports, with no
mapping. Requires nothing from the user but makes cross-model comparison impossible — models are evaluated on different
things.

**2. One model's schema as standard** — all models map to one model's native label set. Simple but arbitrary: it
privileges one model's worldview, penalizes others for not conforming to it, and creates a moving target if that
model's schema changes.

**3. User labels as standard** — model outputs map to whatever labels the user used in their dataset. Feels natural
but breaks down quickly — user labels are inconsistent across datasets, often ambiguous, and can't be reused across
evaluations.

**4. Multi-label annotation** — users tag the same span multiple times, anticipating each model's vocabulary (e.g. a
span tagged as both `US_SSN` and `ID`). Eliminates the mapping layer but requires every model's vocabulary to be known
and stable at annotation time; re-annotation is needed whenever a model is added or changed. It also introduces scoring
ambiguity: if a span carries two labels and a model detects only one, how many false negatives does it generate? A
model's recall on a given entity type becomes a function of how many co-labels its spans carry rather than purely of
its detection quality.

**5. Interactive per-model mapping** — users map their labels to each model's vocabulary interactively, one model at a
time. Gives full transparency but repeats the mapping effort per model per dataset, with no guarantee of consistency
across models.

**6. Canonical entities** (this approach) — a tool-owned, model-agnostic schema that every model and every user
dataset maps to once. The only approach that achieves full comparability, reusability across users, and stability over
time. The trade-off is a one-time mapping step; mapping decisions can silently affect scores, making transparency in
the mapping layer important.

| Approach | Comparability | User burden | Stability | Customizability |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Score against own labels | None | None | High | Low |
| 2. One model as standard | Biased | Low | Low | Low |
| 3. User labels as standard | Per dataset | Medium | Low | High |
| 4. Multi-label annotation | Inconsistent | High | Low | Medium |
| 5. Interactive per-model mapping | Inconsistent | High | Medium | High |
| **6. Canonical entities** | **Full** | **Once** | **High** | **Medium** |

## Why not a flat alias map?

A flat `{raw: canonical}` dict was the original approach. It breaks down as the number of participating tools grows —
every new model means manually adding dozens of aliases. The nested hierarchy makes the *relationship* between entities
explicit and lets the country-prefix engine generate thousands of aliases automatically.

## Why depth 3 as the default?

Depth 2 (the domain branches) is useful for coarse-grained comparison (e.g. "did the model find any government ID?").
Depth 3 provides enough specificity for meaningful evaluation without fragmenting into micro-types that no realistic
model distinguishes. Depth-4+ entities exist for completeness but are intentionally aggregated upward during evaluation.

**Granularity is now annotation-driven and decided per prediction:** rather than accepting a fixed
`canonical_depth` parameter, `CanonicalMapper` projects each prediction to the deepest annotation
label that is an ancestor-or-self of it. More-specific predictions are credited to the gold label
they fall under, while less-specific predictions are not projected downward. A branch may carry
several annotated depths at once — with `PERSON` and `TITLE` both annotated, a `TITLE` prediction
stays `TITLE` and a `NAME` prediction becomes `PERSON`.

This requires no manual tuning and no mapping decision. Multi-model comparisons remain consistent
because the projection depends only on the annotation vocabulary, which is the same for every model
evaluated on that dataset.
